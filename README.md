## Follow-Up Question

Given more time, I'd add a couple more features like searching for specific communities and filters for other attributes, like the number of houses in a community or the average home price. These features would also be added to the mobile version. Clicking on a card for a community would also bring up a list of houses in that community, either on a separate page or on the same page with a nice animation. Accessibility features like a dark mode and font size control would also increase the quality.
